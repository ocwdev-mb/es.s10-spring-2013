  caption: The dose-response curve is probably the most iconic graph from the science
    of pharmacology. The graph above shows the dose-response curves for three common
    opioid painkillers. Notice that fentanyl is 70 times more potent than heroin,
    but addicts and drug abusers generally prefer heroin. Buprenorphine is about 25
    times more potent than heroin but it has a lower intrinsic efficacy (IE). As a
    result, the solid blue buprenorphine line never crosses the dashed red total apnea
    line. This means that even a massive overdose of buprenorphine will not cause
    total apnea (total cessation of breathing), so doctors can safely give buprenorphine
    to recovering addicts. [More details on the course home graphic](/courses/es-s10-drugs-and-the-brain-spring-2013/pages/study-materials#More_details_on_the_course_home_graphic).
